*** Finished compilation of PGPLOT ***
 
Note that if you plan to install PGPLOT in a different
directory than the current one, the following files will be
needed.
 
       libpgplot.a
       libpgplot.so
       grfont.dat
       rgb.txt
 
Also note that subsequent usage of PGPLOT programs requires that
the full path of the chosen installation directory be named in
an environment variable named PGPLOT_DIR.
